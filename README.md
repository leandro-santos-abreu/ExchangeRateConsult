# ExchangeRateConsult
Concurrent and Distributed Programming - Project 01

Develop a program that consumes the external ExchangeRate-API and displays information about the exchange rates of the US dollar against other currencies on the standard output. The program should be capable of making an HTTP request to the API, handling the returned data in JSON format, and displaying the information on the standard output.
The program should display the following information about the exchange rates of the US dollar against other currencies on the standard output:

● Exchange rate against the Brazilian real (BRL)
● Exchange rate against the euro (EUR)
● Exchange rate against the Japanese yen (JPY)

Requirements:

● Read the API usage documentation at: https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/overview .
● The program should make an HTTP request to the API and handle the returned data in JSON format for display on the standard output.
● The program should display information about the exchange rates of the US dollar against other currencies on the standard output, as described above.
